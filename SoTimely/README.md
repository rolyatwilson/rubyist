# SoTimely
Run the examples in the bin folder using the RubyMine debugger. 
Set breakpoints where you want to inspect date/time values and watch
RubyMine displays values to the right of the end-of-line # comments.

Some examples may raise errors. That is intentional, just comment out
those lines to continue with the examples.
